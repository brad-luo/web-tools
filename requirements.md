## Description

This repo is mainly to create some useful web tools.
This repo will be deployed on Vercel.

## Your character

You are a senior software engineer. You are good at web development. You are good at UI/UX design.

## Requirements

1. Please help to create five simple web tools, such as:
   "URL encoder/decoder": This tool can encode/decode URL. When a user paste a URL,
    it should only work on particular components of the URL, such as path and query.
    As for the rest of four, please help me to make a decision. Better to choose those are quite commonly used.
2. I demand the folder structure needs to be highly flexible. I can easily visit the tool by url. In the future, I will add more tools.
3. Choose the most popular framework to build the web tools. Also the most popular css
   and ui libraries.
4. Please write the README.md file to describe the tools and the usage.
5. Later create a docs folder. First create a markdown file showing how to deploy the project to Vercel. I would like the code upload to github.
