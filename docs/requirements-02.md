## New requirements

Now I would like to add google and github OIDC login.

1. When users visit my website, they should login first via google or github.
   Please make it exensible. Later I would like to add more login providers.
   After implementing this feature, I want you to generate a markdown file in the docs folder
   to guide how to configure the login providers.
   
2. Please use client side session to store the user information: the login period is for 1 week.
   If user visit the website, the login period should be extended accordingly.
   I would like to display the username and logo on the top right corner of the website.
